coffee-master
==============

Coffee, the engine, is a MIT open-source Game Development Kit, allowing you to create prototypes, visualizations, softwares or complete games.
The name has nothing to do with Javascript : the full project is based on C++, even scripting.

The full toolset is provided, meaning the only requirement is a Windows Workstation with your favorite IDE :
it supports MinGW+Code::Blocks, professional and express editions of Visual Studio 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2012 (with latest updates).

The latest standalone installer is on the official website : http://www.coffee3d.net/
