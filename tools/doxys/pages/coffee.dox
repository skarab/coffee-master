/** \mainpage Documentation
Welcome to the API documentation of Coffee.

In Coffee, all coding is done using C/C++, in a user friendly way, that's why you may refer this as the Scripting Documentation.
It describes all Coffee classes, useful when writing custom components/plugins.

Please note that this documentation is generated right from the code base, the documented parts will increase overtime.
For any question, just mail to support@coffee3d.net
